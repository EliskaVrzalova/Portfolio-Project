### Project Summary
1. <b>Website:</b>  Portfolio website
2. <b>Purpose:</b> My own website demonstrating creativity and my skills and ambitions in areas of web design and UI/UX design. This website is to show my creativity, my design choices and my progress in web design and development. It will be useful material to showcase in the third year when I will be looking for work placement.
3. <b>Audience:</b> Anyone interested in me and my work.
4. <b>Live site:</b> https://eliskavrzalova.github.io/Portfolio-Project/

### Design Rationale
5. <b>Theme and topic:</b> <br> Portfolio website allowed me to have unlimited design options since websites of this kind are often very colourful, lively and creative.
6. <b>My goals:</b>
- chance to any visitor to get to know me, my work, my design choices and my further goals and ambitions
- to show my progress in web design and development
- to impress website visitors
- I implemented some new features I have not tried to do so far to again lear something new
- I paid more attention to design consistency and accessibility

7. <b>Research insights:</b><br>
I have researched many portfolio websites (mainly on https://www.siteinspire.com/) to look at various layouts, design ideas and content to gain some inspiration for my own portfolio.<br>
During this phase I research website both on desktop and mobile to see different layouts and to learn more about responsive design.

11. <b>Responsivness and accessibility:</b>

### Deployment Notes
12. <b>Github pages:</b> https://eliskavrzalova.github.io/Portfolio-Project/
13. <b>Deployment issues and how they were resolved: </b><br>
This was not exactly an issue but since this was my first time doing Github pages I did not implemet {base} right away during coding. If I did it would have saved me some time<br>
I failed to build the website few times. The main problem was wrongly named .nojekyll file (I had .noJekyll instead of .nojekyll). I also had some bash problems when I was clearing the gh-pages branch and struggled to put the build folder content in the root of the branch. After I fixed the .nojekyll file, it cleared most of the problem and I managed to build and deploy the website successfully.

### Reflections and Next Steps
14. <b>What went well in the project:</b><br>
Implementing all my design ideas. I also achieved aesthetics I really like and represents me well.<br>
I have taken majority of the design from my penpot prototype.<br>
I was much more comfortable with responsive design then in my previous projects.
15. <b>What could be improved:</b><br>
I think the responsivness code can be always improved and deserves big amount of time to be spend on.<br>
I have tried my best on consistency but it is definitely not perfect<br>
I feel like I would come up with more design ideas if I had more time which would enhance the UX and usability of my website. Overall I am satisfied with what I achieved.

19. <b>Suggestions for future development</b><br>
Spend more time on consistency, responsiveness and accessibility<br>
Study more JS, HTML and CSS to create amazing things<br>
Research other website or related content tp gain even more ideas and inspiration<br>
Understand the Github pages build and deployment more to avoid mistakes and troubles with it.
