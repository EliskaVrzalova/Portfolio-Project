I'm Eliska, an aspiring designer with interest and passion in UI/ UX, animation, concept art and simply any other design you can think of:). <br> I always loved being creative- whether it's through drawing, problem-solving or dealing with challenges. Ever since I was a kid, I had design in my mind wondering and observing what it is and how people interact with it.</p> <p>Beyond art and design, I'm very active and adventurous person. I love sports, exploring new places and pushing my limits. I do my best to translate the energy to my designs- i want them to feel dynamic, original and full of life.
                I always look around and seek for inspiration because I myself want to become one for others. <br> Right now, I'm honing my skills, experimenting with different techniques, and pushing myself to grow. This portfolio is a reflection of my ideas, creativity and passion for crafting original design that leaves a lasting impact.<br> I hope you will enjoy the experience this website offers you and feel the message I'm sending you. <br></p><div class="signature svelte-qnao3q"><img alt="Eliska's signature" class="svelte-qnao3q"></div></div> <div class="SW-skills svelte-qnao3q"><img alt="photoshop icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"> <img alt="in design icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"> <img alt="adobe illustrator icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"> <img alt="adobe animte icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"> <img alt="visual studio icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"> <img alt="inkscape icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"> <img alt="canva icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"> <img alt="figma icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"> <img alt="penpot icon" class="svelte-qnao3q"></div></div>`);function j(u){var t=k(),o=e(t),y=e(o);i(y,"src",`${s??""}/aboutme.png`),n(o);var r=a(o,2),l=a(e(r),5),b=e(l);i(b,"src",`${s??""}/eliska.png`),n(l),n(r);var g=a(r,2),m=e(g);i(m,"src",`${s??""}/photoshop.png`);var c=a(m,2);i(c,"src",`${s??""}/indesign.png`);var v=a(c,2);i(v,"src",`${s??""}/illustrator.png`);var d=a(v,2);i(d,"src",`${s??""}/animate.png`);var p=a(d,2);i(p,"src",`${s??""}/visualstudio.png`);var h=a(p,2);i(h,"src",`${s??""}/inkscape.png`);var q=a(h,2);i(q,"src",`${s??""}/canva.png`);var f=a(q,2);i(f,"src",`${s??""}/figma.png`);var w=a(f,2);i(w,"src",`${s??""}/penpot.png`),n(g),n(t),I(u,t)}export{j as component};
